# Introduction to Alarm Management
## Background

Prior to the era of distributed control systems (DCS), creating an alarm was manual, time consuming and expensive. A process control system had few dozen alarms that an operator to easily monitor and act upon each one immediately.

The introduction of distributed control systems (DCS) changed the traditional alarm systems. It becomes so easy to add new alarms for instruments linked to a DCS, leading to an alarm overload on the operating console of the DCS. Operators are overloaded with hundred of alarms that may not be relevant and where in the event of a serious incident, can cause an alarm flooding (interfering with the operator’s ability to understand and respond correctly to the situation).

## Why is Alarm Management Important?

Accident investigations have revealed that poor alarm system performance contributed to a significant number of industrial accidents.
The top 4 major accidents in the history are: 

• Three Mile Island - 1979

• Piper Alpha - 1988

• Milford Haven Refinery - 1994

• Buncefield Oil Storage - 2005

## Alarm Management


Alarm management refers to the processes and practices for determining, documenting, designing, monitoring, and maintaining alarm messages from process automation and safety systems.
Alarm management provides a structured method to create an effective alarm system that can help address the problems faced by highly automated systems.
This method can help to reduce the number of alarms to a minimum, which could reduce the possibility of the
operator getting overwhelmed in an unfolding incident. The goal is to ensure that in an emergency the operator
is only presented with information that is necessary to manage the situation. This is an example of how Human
Element considerations at the design stage can lead to significant improvements in safety.


**Here is some bold text**

## Here is a secondary heading

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
